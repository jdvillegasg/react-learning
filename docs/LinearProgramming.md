## E-commerce marketing

Objetive: maximize return.

Variables: budget allocation for each marketing channel and each category (i.e. if there are 5 channels and 3 categories, there will be 15 variables).

**Constraints definition** 

The performance of a channel measures the return of investing on a channel of a particular category (i.e. for investing in one unit of channel 1 and category 3 you have a return of 30). 

One might want to have a '*boundary*' (bound for the constraint) seting an expectation for the returnd value of the investment on the channels of a particular category. For example, one might want to have at least a returned value of 50 for the investment on the channels of a particular category, and have the same for each category.
